    ESRS E5 1.
    The objective of this Standard is to specify Disclosure Requirements which will enable users of the sustainability statement to understand&#58;
    (a)
    how the undertaking affects resource use, including resource efficiency, avoiding the depletion of resources and the sustainable sourcing and use of renewable resources (referred to in this Standard as “resource use and circular economy”) in terms of material positive and negative actual or potential impacts;
    (b)
    any actions taken, and the result of such actions, to prevent or mitigate actual or potential negative impacts arising from resource use, including its measures to help decoupling its economic growth from the use of materials, and to address risks and opportunities;
    2
    (c)
    the plans and capacity of the undertaking to adapt its strategy and business model in line with circular economy principles including but not limited to minimising waste, maintaining the value of products, materials and other resources at their highest value and enhancing their efficient use in production and consumption;
    (d)
    the nature, type and extent of the undertaking’s material risks and opportunities related to the undertaking’s impacts and dependencies, arising from resource use and circular economy, and how the undertaking manages them; and
    (e)
    the financial effects on the undertaking over the short-, medium- and long-term of material risks and opportunities arising from the undertaking’s impacts and dependencies on resource use and circular economy.

  heading: <BR><h6>Explanation</h6>
  content: |
    Circular economy means an economic system in which the value of products, materials and other resources in the economy is maintained for as long as possible, enhancing their efficient use in production and consumption, thereby reducing the environmental impact of their use, minimising waste and the release of hazardous substances at all stages of their life cycle, including through the application of the waste hierarchy. The goal is to maximise and maintain the value of the technical and biological resources, products and materials by creating a system that allows for durability, optimal use or re-use, refurbishment, remanufacturing, recycling and nutrient cycling.Circular economy includes the sub-topics resource inflows including resource use, resource outflows related to products and services and waste.
