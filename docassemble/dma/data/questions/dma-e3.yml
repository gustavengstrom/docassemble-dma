    how the undertaking affects water and marine resources, in terms of material positive and negative actual or potential impacts;
    (b)
    any actions taken, and the result of such actions to prevent or mitigate material actual or potential negative impacts, to protect water and marine resources, also with reference to reduction of water consumption, and to address risks and opportunities;
    (c)
    whether, how and to what extent the undertaking contributes to the European Green Deal’s ambitions for fresh air, clean water, healthy soil and biodiversity, as well as to the sustainability of the blue economy and fisheries sectors, taking account of the following&#58; Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (EU Water Framework Directive), Directive 2008/56/EC of the European Parliament and of
    the Council2 (EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive), Directive 2014/89/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council3 (EU Maritime Spatial Planning Directive), the Sustainable Development Goals (in particular SDG 6 Clean water and sanitation and 14 Life below water), and respect of global environmental limits (e.g. biosphere integrity, ocean acidification, freshwater use, and biogeochemical flows planetary boundaries);
