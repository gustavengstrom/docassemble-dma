  Please describe how the undertaking determines whether an impact, risk, and/or opportunity is material? 
help:
  label: Help?
  heading: <BR><h6>Explanation</h6>
  content: |
    Material&#x27; can be described as whether risks, opportunities and/or impacts are of importance to the undertaking. For example, risks regarding business conduct are material to large corporations, as business conduct is of importance to large corporations. IG Materiality assessment 8&#58; &quot;The undertaking assesses the materiality of impacts for reporting purposes against criteria of severity and likelihood. This also includes setting appropriate quantitative and/or qualitative thresholds for reporting purposes. Severity is based on the scale, scope and irremediable character of negative impacts and the scale and scope of positive impacts.&quot; ESRS 1 paragraph AR 15 states&#58; &quot;Once the undertaking has identified its risks and opportunities, it shall determine which of them are material for reporting. This shall be based on a combination of (i) the likelihood of occurrence and (ii) the potential magnitude of financial effects determined in the basis of appropriate thresholds. In this step it shall consider the contribution of those risks and opportunities to financial effects in the short-, medium- and long-term.&quot;
