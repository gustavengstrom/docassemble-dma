    ESRS S2 1.
    The objective of this Standard is to specify disclosure requirements which will enable users of the sustainability statement to understand material impacts on value chain workers connected with the undertaking’s own operations and value chain, including through its products or services, as well as through its business relationships, and its related material risks and opportunities, including&#58;
    (a)
    how the undertaking affects workers in its value chain, in terms of material positive and negative actual or potential impacts; (b)
    any actions taken, and the result of such actions, to prevent, mitigate or remediate actual or potential negative impacts, and to address risks and opportunities;
    (c)
    the nature, type and extent of the undertaking’s material risks and opportunities, including those related to its impacts and dependencies on workers in the value chain, and how the undertaking manages them; and
    (d)
    the financial effects on the undertaking over the short-, medium- and long-term of material risks and opportunities, including those arising from the undertaking’s impacts and dependencies on workers in the value chain.

    Worker in the value chain is an individual performing work in the value chain of the undertaking, regardless of the existence or nature of any contractual relationship with that undertaking. In the ESRS, the following is included in the scope of workers in the value chain&#58; all workers in the undertaking’s upstream and downstream value chain who are or can be materially impacted by the undertaking, this includes impacts that are caused or contributed to by the undertaking and those which are directly linked to its own operations, products, or services through its business relationships. This includes all workers who are not included in the scope of “Own workforce” (“Own workforce” includes workers who are in an employment relationship with the undertaking (‘employees’) and non-employee workers who are either individual contractors supplying labour to the undertaking (‘self-employed workers’) or workers provided by undertakings primarily engaged in ‘employment activities’ (NACE Code N78)). Workers in the value chain includes the sub-topic working conditions that include the sub-sub-topics secure employment, working time, adequate wages, social dialogue, freedom of association, the existence of work councils, collective bargaining, work-life balance, health and safety. Antoher sub-topic is equal treatment and opportunities for all, including the sub-sub-topics gender equality and equal pay for work of equal value, training and skills development, employment and inclusion of persons with disabilities, measures against violence and harassment in the workplace and diversity. The last sub-topic is other work-related rights including sub-sub-topics child labour, forced labour, adequate housing, water and sanitation, and privacy.
