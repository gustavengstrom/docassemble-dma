    ESRS E1 1.
    The objective of this Standard is to specify Disclosure Requirements which will enable users of sustainability statements to understand&#58;
    (a)
    how the undertaking affects climate change, in terms of material positive and negative actual and potential impacts;
    (b)
    the undertaking’s past, current, and future mitigation efforts in line with the Paris Agreement (or an updated international agreement on climate change) and compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5°C;
    (c)
    the plans and capacity of the undertaking to adapt its strategy and business model, in line with the transition to a sustainable economy and to contribute to limiting global warming to 1.5°C;
    (d)
    any other actions taken by the undertaking, and the result of such actions to prevent, mitigate or remediate actual or potential negative impacts, and to address risks and opportunities;
    (e)
    the nature, type and extent of the undertaking’s material risks and opportunities arising from the undertaking’s impacts and dependencies on climate change, and how the undertaking manages them; and
    (f)
    the financial effects on the undertaking over the short-, medium- and long-term of risks and opportunities arising from the undertaking’s impacts and dependencies on climate change.

  heading: <BR><h6>Explanation</h6>
  content: |
    Climate-related opportunities refer to the potential positive effects related to climate change on the undertaking. Efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change can produce opportunities for undertakings, such as through resource efficiency and cost savings, the adoption and utilisation of low-emissions energy sources, the development of new products and services, and building resilience along the supply chain. Climate-related opportunities will vary depending on the region, market, and industry where an undertaking operates. Climate-related physical risks are risks that arise from the physical effects of climate change. They typically include acute physical risks, which arise from particular hazards, especially weather-related events such as storms, floods, fires or heatwaves, and chronic physical risks, which arise from longer-term changes in the climate, such as temperature changes, rising sea levels, reduced water availability, biodiversity loss and changes in land and soil productivity.  Climate-related transition risks are risks that arise from the transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy. They typically include policy risks, legal risks, technology risks, market risks and reputational risks and can arise from related transition events.
