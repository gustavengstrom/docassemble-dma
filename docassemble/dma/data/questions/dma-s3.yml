    ESRS S3. 1.
    The objective of this Standard is to specify disclosure requirements which will enable users of the sustainability statement to understand material impacts on affected communities connected with the undertaking’s own operations and value chain, including through its products or services, as well as through its business relationships, and its related material risks and opportunities, including&#58;
    (a)
    how the undertaking affects communities, in areas where impacts are most likely to be present and severe, in terms of material positive and negative actual or potential impacts;
    (b)
    any actions taken, and the result of such actions, to prevent, mitigate or remediate actual or potential negative impacts, and to address risks and opportunities;
    (c)
    the nature, type and extent of the undertaking’s material risks and opportunities related to its impacts and dependencies on affected communities, and how the undertaking manages them; and
    (d)
    the financial effects on the undertaking over the short-, medium- and long-term of material risks and opportunities arising from the undertaking’s impacts and dependencies on affected communities.
